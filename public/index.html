        <p class="aboutUsP">The janitorial industry has been plagued with cut-throat pricing by companies that have no intention of delivering quality services. Their goal is to win the bid, not to provide superior service.</p>

        <p class="aboutUsP">This approach has been encouraged all too often in our industry by clients whose only goal is finding the lowest bid. What follows from this practice is frustration due to low cleaning standards and constant turnover.</p>
            
            
         <p class="aboutUsP">The Trinity approach is to provide quality cleaning at a fair price. We believe this will be the ultimate win-win for our clients and our company. Our ability to retain our clients' confidence has been proven repeatedly. Collectively, the Trinity Management Team has over 50 years experience serving both government and commercial clients. In addition, we are one of only a handful of companies in the United States to have a certified member of the LEED AP from the United States Green Building Council on staff.</p>
                
        <p class="aboutUsP">We are centrally located to serve all of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura Counties.</p>
